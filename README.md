# R-Seminar Week 1: Project Management with Git and GitHub

This is an example project code repository for UW's Fall 2015 Biology R-seminar.

**Instructions for Using This Repository**

1. Do **not** clone this repository directly to your local machine. First fork it to your own workspace in GitHub. Click the "Fork" button in the top-right of the repository's page and select your workspace.

2. Navigate GitHub's site to the new forked repository in your workspace to confirm that it is now "yours". This page should have a URL scheme similar to http://github.com/*username*/*repository_name*

3. Now you are ready to Clone it to your local machine. In RStudio, go to File > New Project... Now select Version Control > Git. Clone the repository to your local machine. The repository URL should be https://github.com/*username*/*repository_name*.git. Choose a directory name and indicate where on your local machine you want the files to live, for example ~/Ian/code/.

4. Click "Create Project". This will create a directory and that will sync to the remote repository. It will also download the files (README,.gitignore,LICENSE) that you created on GitHub to this directory, and create a new Rstudio Project file.

5. Now you should be able to open and modify the example script, stored in the "scripts" directory. Once you are finished with a block of edits, don't forget to stage, commit, pull and push your changes.
